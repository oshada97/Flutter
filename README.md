### Flutter Learning Path

## Why Flutter?

Flutter is a free and open source Google mobile UI framework that provides a fast and expressive way for developers to build native apps on both IOS and Android using a single codebase.

# Flutter vs Native application app development (Java/Kotlin and XML)?
Flutter provides the ease to develop great apps with modern UIs along with support for implementing machine level instruction as you would do in case of Android. No other hybrid frameworks such as Xamarin, Ionix or PhoneGap give you this propensity.
